This is a simple website made only using HTML and CSS


the idea behind this website is "making better" - an ngo that helps and supports other ngo's and people in need
  
do not belong to a big group example there are many NGO's working to support people suffering from cancer but there are many such rare illness /diseases which people suffer and need financial support for treatment, 
are affected due to occurrence of a natural calamity
occurrance of unfortunate event in once's life , example loosing family member in the pandemic and going through a very bad financial condition
small NGO's that need funds to run
all you need to do is register yourself and share us documents as a proof for your ask so we can then authenticate and post the ask here

this is just simple idea with only the frontend
